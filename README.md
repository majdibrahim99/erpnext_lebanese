### Key Components

#### 1. Chart of Accounts JSON Structure

The `lebanese_standard.json` file contains:
- Account hierarchy with parent-child relationships
- Account numbers
- Multilingual names (English, Arabic, French)
- Root types for proper categorization

Example structure:
```json
{
  "tree": {
    "EQUITY & LONG TERM DEBTS": {
      "root_type": "Equity",
      "account_number": "1000",
      "arabic_name": "رأس المال",
      "french_name": "COMPTES DE CAPITAUX PERMANENTS",
      "CAPITAL": {
        "account_number": "10",
        "arabic_name": "رأس المال",
        "french_name": "CAPITAL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Company Override (`company_override.py`)

- Extends the standard ERPNext `Company` DocType
- Automatically sets chart of accounts for Lebanese companies
- Handles account creation with multilingual support
- Sets default receivable and payable accounts

#### 3. Chart Creation Override (`chart_of_accounts_create_override.py`)

- Custom chart creation logic that handles multilingual metadata
- Properly identifies metadata keys (`arabic_name`, `french_name`)
- Sets default account types for income/expense accounts
- Handles nested account structures

#### 4. Language API (`api.py`)

- Whitelisted method: `get_account_language_labels`
- Returns localized account labels based on selected language
- Caches chart tree for performance
- Maps account numbers to multilingual labels

#### 5. Client-Side JavaScript (`account_tree.js`)

- Adds language selector to Chart of Accounts tree view
- Fetches and applies localized labels
- Handles RTL/LTR switching
- Updates tree nodes dynamically

#### 6. RTL Styles (`account_tree_rtl.css`)

- CSS rules for RTL layout
- Right-aligned text for Arabic
- Proper padding and margin adjustments
- Balance area positioning for RTL

### Hooks Configuration

The app uses several Frappe hooks:

```python
# Override Company DocType
override_doctype_class = {
    "Company": "erpnext_lebanese.overrides.company_override.LebaneseCompany"
}

# Override setup wizard methods
override_whitelisted_methods = {
    "erpnext.setup.setup_wizard.setup_wizard.get_setup_stages": "...",
    "erpnext.setup.setup_wizard.setup_wizard.setup_complete": "..."
}

# Inject JavaScript for Account tree view
doctype_tree_js = {
    "Account": "public/js/account_tree.js"
}

# Include RTL CSS
app_include_css = "/assets/erpnext_lebanese/css/account_tree_rtl.css"
```

## Configuration

### Enabling Balance Display

To show account balances in the Chart of Accounts:

1. Go to **Accounts Settings**
2. Enable **Show Balance in Chart of Accounts**
3. Balances will appear next to account names

### Language Preferences

The app automatically detects the user's language preference from:
- User's language setting in **My Account**
- System default language

You can manually change the language using the dropdown in the Chart of Accounts view.
